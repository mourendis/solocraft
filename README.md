<summary>Why</summary>

To my liking the baskets should not be present in Kalimdor,
same for bushes in Eastern Kingdoms.

<details>
<summary>Misc</summary>
There are some additional gameobjects under the building.
Use `.go 1623.69 -3072.96 76.7227 0` to check.
Those gameobjects could be adjasted.

There are some horses, I would like to make those lvl 60 rares.
